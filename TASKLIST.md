## 🔄 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT TASKS

### 1. Combat Freeze Fix ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Description**: Fixed critical bug causing game freeze during combat  
**Solution**: Removed non-existent `WaitForMessageQueueCompletionAsync()` calls and replaced with `Task.Delay(50)` for UI synchronization
**Files Modified**: `Code/Combat/CombatManager.cs`
**Verification**: All 4 method calls fixed, no linter errors

### 2. Real-Time Combat Display ✅
**Status**: Completed  
**Description**: Added real-time UI rendering during combat  
**Solution**: Added `Dispatcher.UIThread.InvokeAsync()` calls after each action to yield to UI thread
**Files Modified**: `Code/Combat/CombatManager.cs`
**Result**: Combat actions now display in real-time as they happen

### 3. Narrative System Validation 🔄
**Status**: In Progress  
**Description**: Verify narrative system works after refactoring  
**Tasks**:
- [x] Verify BattleNarrative integration - working with new formatters
- [ ] Test narrative event detection in combat

- [ ] Document narrative flow updates

### 3. Environmental Actions System 🔄
**Status**: In Progress  
**Description**: Get environmental actions working after refactoring  
**Tasks**:

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test tuning parameter save functionality
- [ ] Implement load from saved configs
- [ ] Add export/import features
- [ ] Document tuning workflow

### 5. Screen Flow Coordination ✅
**Status**: Completed (Phase 1)  
**Description**: Centralize high-level screen transitions through a dedicated coordinator to simplify UI flow and debugging  
**Tasks**:
- [x] Create `GameScreenCoordinator` to manage core screen transitions (GameLoop, DungeonCompletion, Inventory)  
- [x] Wire `Game.ShowGameLoop`, `Game.ShowDungeonCompletion`, and `Game.ShowInventory` through `GameScreenCoordinator`  
- [x] Simplify `InventoryMenuHandler.ShowInventory()` to delegate through the coordinator  
- [x] Document the new screen coordination pattern in `UI_RENDERER_ARCHITECTURE.md`  
- [ ] Gradually migrate remaining display entry points (e.g., dungeon selection, death screen) to use `GameScreenCoordinator` (Future)
