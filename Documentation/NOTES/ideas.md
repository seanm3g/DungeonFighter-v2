1. Do a monte-carlo stats on the default random chance of playing the game.  Is it possible to die in Round 1? What if you always equip items every time and choose the easiest dungeon, what about when you choose the hardest dungeon (everytime, but also just in the first time) What do we want those chance to be?
2. What if the items could only get one prefix and one suffix, but the more rare the roll the more dice you roll to determine which one you get, either but adding them, or just multiplying your chances of getting a rarer stat. 
3. Start with the actions swapped backwards to incentivize you to swap them at level 2. (teach the idea)
4. What if when you loot you get to pick from 1 of 3 items (of the same type?)
5. Attacks are per turn, and length could require (2 actions) to cast.
6. Make sure that attack speed is on a diminishing returns curve?
7. Add an action that increases dice for each 1-13 rolled, reset when 14 is rolled higher. | Pity Cuck
8. Meteor should be amplified by the amount of fire spells you have.  | Meteor is one of 4 actions you get from becoming a wizard.  you pick the action or something?
9.  When a treant bleeds, it bleeds sap, that slows your attacks.
10. range would be distance, and melee you'd have to hit first or something?
11. Not all encounters should be fighting, find a monk who gives you +5 magic find (for dungeon or perma-character)
12. Your dungeon selection influences your affinity to certain groups, (Undead vs Forest) undead gives you lifesteal, forest gives you aura's bonuses, etc.  Maybe a gold for goblins but then orcs always rage at you. 
13. % of a project that has fighters attached. 25% small bonuses, 50% medium, 100% big bonus
14. Barbarian core action is to ignore armor on basic attack. | increases requirement of dice roll +1.  Really the idea is for dice manipulation to affect the entire thing, just combos, just basics, or just misses. What would be good language for that.
15. Remove miss, add combo chance in dice rolls
16. for every points above 20 it amplifies the crit. OR it adds that to the next roll you have.
17. Your title should be based on your attributes (10 INT, 25 INT, 50 INT 80 INT, 90 INT, 100 INT, for each attribute though)
18. Weapons should always have a guaranteed action, and one random weapon action with it. Magic Missle + (1 of 3 or something)
19. Closer to end of battle adds more narrative flavor ("color") text.
20. Add narrative beats based on context to the game.
21. Add slots for an environemnt action happening IF it rolled for one.  "The air is cooler." Random narrative filler until something happens.  Teach the mechanics of the room, adding tone to the game, and a clean run where nothing bad happened.
22. Amp should apply to effects not just damage.
23. Level one you start with a sword, and when you get to level 2 you choose between 1 of 3 rewards that are the other classes weapons.
    *Stick with the one you're in and get a bonus added to the weapons. 
    *You hit level 2 and you get the upgrade to your gear first.  THen the loot you get is the 3 options for the other classes, all 3 rolled the same thing you were just gifted, so one can be more rare or less rare than another. That's really how you select your class.
    * What if you start at level 0 with no weapon and a dummy.  You complete that and you start at level 1 choosing this gear.
    *I kind of like starting with the axe first because it chooses a lane and shows you how that works and gives you a perk with it.
24. Leveing with a weapon adds a bonus to that weapon in some way.
    This is a roll, and is 3 options that sometimes produces an uncommon or rare bonus.
        Or should this be a random roll of rarity, that then produces adds which effect to the gear.
25. Be able to add things to gear after they've been created.
26. is ther a way to have a certain literal threshold convert into a increase to the exponential, and reset in a way where then the lower value in the base being incremented by small measurements makse a big difference again.
27. Hide the item (but it has weight) but you don't know if it's good or not.  Or reveal partial information but don't have it yet.
28. 0 to level 1 is your "starter pokemon". Fight a dummy
29. sacrifice gear to amplify fighter and make yourself more demonic.  If you become more and more of a demon you become more of the demon boss.  It's a prestiege for gear.  You become more and more demonic.  You have a higher chance of becoming the demon boss each time you roll.  This functions as a character burn.
30. Let the fighter pick a dungeon | 3 back to back level 3 dungeons, increase the scale of dungeons available, it accelerates.
two dimensions - level and the specific dungeon
31. Make enemies have modifiers like archetypes so you're not always fighting the same creature.  A berzeker spider and a Juggernaut spider are different things.
32.  What if fractions are just dice-rolls with a threshold (so rolling a 2.1) means you get 2 or 3 damage, but the .1 would roll as a needing 9 or higher on a d10 to get it, otherwise it works towards 2.
83. add multi-attacks per action
84. Add a roll for enemy weapons (that can affect the damage output they have, or actions they have available)
85. Fix menus to always use 0 as return to main menu.
86. Narrative Beats should be for COMBO, health change, thresholds of health, More the combat goes on.  Critical strikes.
87. Only some enemies should have hands.  Only hands can hold items.
88. Enemies different flags should be what affects enviromental things affect them, and how.
89. Characters should be able to trigger environmental things.  | douse, douse, douse, gasoline. or EARTHQUAKE should trigger an effect that could hurt both player and enemy.  Maybe the character has immunity to that.
90. Live balance tuning, beta until certian amount of dead fighters.  Dead fighters unlocks things.
91. The ability to disarm your oppoonent as a status effect.  It takes an action to recover.
92. An action that happens in the sequence in response to the environment. Dodge or something.
93. Could you include movement in between actions as sort of navigation actions.?
