# Known Issues - DungeonFighter-v2

Track of known problems, their status, and potential solutions.

## Critical Issues

### None Currently Known
*No critical issues identified at this time.*

## High Priority Issues

### Issue: Validate enemy action sets include damage
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Description**: Some enemies defined only utility/debuff actions which could lead to unwinnable (for enemy) encounters.

**Mitigation**:
- Data fix to include at least one damaging action per enemy (e.g., added `POISON BITE` to `Prism Spider`).
- Loader safeguard injects `BASIC ATTACK` if missing.
- Test `--test-enemies` validates configuration.

**Next Steps**:
- Keep validation test in CI/regression runs.

## Medium Priority Issues

### None Currently Known
*No medium priority issues identified at this time.*

## Low Priority Issues

### None Currently Known
*No low priority issues identified at this time.*

## Resolved Issues

### Issue: Enemies Dying in 1 Hit
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Date Resolved**: Recent
**Description**: Enemies were dying in single hits instead of the target 10 actions due to balance issues.

**Root Causes**:
1. Double scaling of enemy stats (EnemyLoader.cs + Enemy.cs constructor)
2. Weapon damage scaling too high (1.55x multiplier)
3. Enemy DPS system using old level scaling formula

**Solution**:
1. Removed double scaling in Enemy.cs constructor
2. Reduced weapon scaling to 0.42x
3. Updated EnemyDPSSystem to match current system

**Verification**: Balance analysis shows proper "actions to kill" ratio.

### Issue: Combat Balance Broken
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Date Resolved**: Recent
**Description**: Combat was severely unbalanced with heroes dealing 32+ damage to enemies with 26 health.

**Solution**:
1. Increased player base health from 150 to 200
2. Increased health per level from 3 to 5
3. Reduced player base attributes from 15 to 8
4. Reduced critical hit multiplier from 1.5 to 1.3
5. Reduced enemy damage multiplier from 1.0 to 0.7

**Verification**: DPS analysis shows balanced combat duration.

### Issue: Weapon Damage Scaling Too High
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Date Resolved**: Recent
**Description**: Weapon damage formulas were adding massive multipliers causing excessive damage.

**Solution**:
1. Reduced weapon scaling multipliers to 0.42x
2. Updated scaling formulas in TuningConfig.json
3. Verified scaling calculations in ScalingManager.cs

**Verification**: Weapon damage now scales appropriately with level.

### Issue: Action Damage Multipliers Too High
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Date Resolved**: Recent
**Description**: High-damage actions were dealing excessive damage compared to basic attacks.

**Solution**:
1. Reduced high-damage actions from 1.6x to 1.2x (-25% damage)
2. Reduced environmental actions from 1.8x to 1.3x (-28% damage)
3. Updated action damage calculations

**Verification**: Action damage now balanced with basic attacks.

### Issue: Armor Generation Amplifying Corrupted Values
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Date Resolved**: Recent
**Description**: Armor generation system was amplifying existing corrupted values instead of generating proper base values, creating massive numbers like 30,130,992 for Tier 2 armor.

**Root Causes**:
1. `GenerateArmorFromConfig` method was multiplying existing armor values by tier multipliers
2. System was using corrupted existing values as base instead of generating clean base values
3. No proper base value lookup system for different tiers and slots

**Solution**:
1. Replaced amplification logic with proper base value generation
2. Created `GetBaseArmorForTierAndSlot` method with predefined base values
3. Implemented tier-based armor progression (Tier 1: 2/4/2, Tier 2: 4/8/4, etc.)
4. Added fallback calculation for unknown tier/slot combinations

**Verification**: Armor values now generate reasonable numbers (Tier 2 head: 4 instead of 30,130,992).

**Related Files**:
- `Code/GameDataGenerator.cs` (GenerateArmorFromConfig method)
- `GameData/Armor.json` (generated armor values)

**Prevention**: Always use base value generation instead of amplifying existing values in data generation systems.
