- Support for multi-hit, self-damage, roll bonuses, stat bonuses, etc.

### Character Class Extensions
- Temporary stat bonuses with duration tracking
- Health percentage calculations
- Stat threshold checking
- Effect duration management

### JSON Integration
- All 30 actions loaded from Actions.json
