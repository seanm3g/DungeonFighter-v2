1. Do a monte-carlo stats on the default random chance of playing the game.  Is it possible to die in Round 1? What if you always equip items every time and choose the easiest dungeon, what about when you choose the hardest dungeon (everytime, but also just in the first time) What do we want those chance to be?
2. What if the items could only get one prefix and one suffix, but the more rare the roll the more dice you roll to determine which one you get, either but adding them, or just multiplying your chances of getting a rarer stat. 
3. Start with the actions swapped backwards to incentivize you to swap them at level 2. (teach the idea)
4. What if when you loot you get to pick from 1 of 3 items (of the same type?)
5. Attacks are per turn, and length could require (2 actions) to cast.
6. Make sure that attack speed is on a diminishing returns curve?
7. Add an action that increases dice for each 1-13 rolled, reset when 14 is rolled higher. | Pity Cuck
8. Meteor should be amplified by the amount of fire spells you have.  | Meteor is one of 4 actions you get from becoming a wizard.  you pick the action or something?
9.  When a treant bleeds, it bleeds sap, that slows your attacks.
10. range would be distance, and melee you'd have to hit first or something?
11. Not all encounters should be fighting, find a monk who gives you +5 magic find (for dungeon or perma-character)
12. Your dungeon selection influences your affinity to certain groups, (Undead vs Forest) undead gives you lifesteal, forest gives you aura's bonuses, etc.)  Maybe a gold for goblins but then orcs always rage at you. 
13. % of a project that has fighters attached. 25% small bonuses, 50% medium, 100% big bonus
14. Barbarian core action is to ignore armor.
