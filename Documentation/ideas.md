1. Do a monte-carlo stats on the default random chance of playing the game.  Is it possible to die in Round 1? What if you always equip items every time and choose the easiest dungeon, what about when you choose the hardest dungeon (everytime, but also just in the first time) What do we want those chance to be?
2. What if the items could only get one prefix and one suffix, but the more rare the roll the more dice you roll to determine which one you get, either but adding them, or just multiplying your chances of getting a rarer stat. 
3. Start with the actions swapped backwards to incentivize you to swap them at level 2. (teach the idea)
4. What if when you loot you get to pick from 1 of 3 items (of the same type?)
5. Attacks are per turn, and length could require (2 actions) to cast.
6. Make sure that attack speed is on a diminishing returns curve?
