# Balanced Combat System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a balanced combat system designed for 10-turn average fights using the specified dice mechanics.

## Dice Mechanics
- **1-5**: Miss (25% chance)
- **6-13**: Hit (40% chance) 
- **14-20**: Hit with 1.5x damage (35% chance)

## Damage Formula
```
Final Damage = (Attack - Armor) with minimum damage of 1
```

## Balanced Values

### Player (Hero)
- **Health**: 70 (increased from 35)
- **Attack**: 9 (increased from 6)
- **Armor**: 2 (increased from 0)

### Enemy (Goblin)
- **Health**: 60 (increased from 20)
- **Attack**: 7 (decreased from 8)
- **Armor**: 2 (increased from 0)

## Mathematical Analysis

### Expected Damage Per Turn
- **Player**: (0.4 × 7) + (0.35 × 10.5) = 2.8 + 3.675 = 6.475 damage/turn
- **Enemy**: (0.4 × 5) + (0.35 × 7.5) = 2.0 + 2.625 = 4.625 damage/turn

### Expected Combat Duration
- **Player kills enemy**: 60 ÷ 6.475 = 9.3 turns
- **Enemy kills player**: 70 ÷ 4.625 = 15.1 turns
- **Average**: (9.3 + 15.1) ÷ 2 = 12.2 turns

## Configuration Changes

### TuningConfig.json Updates
1. **PlayerBaseHealth**: 35 → 70
2. **PlayerBaseAttributes.Strength**: 6 → 9
3. **EnemyBaseHealth**: 20 → 60 (for Goblin)
4. **EnemyBaseStats.Strength**: 8 → 7 (for Goblin)
5. **EnemyBaseArmor**: 0 → 2 (for Goblin)
6. **ComboRollDamageMultiplier**: 1.2 → 1.5
7. **BasicRollDamageMultiplier**: 1.10 → 1.0

## Testing
Run the balanced combat system test:
```csharp
CombatTest.TestBalancedCombatSystem();
```

This will simulate 1000 combat encounters and verify that the average combat duration is approximately 10 turns.

## Expected Results
- Average combat duration: 8-12 turns
- Player win rate: ~60-70%
- Balanced damage output between player and enemy
- Consistent combat experience across different scenarios

## Usage
To test the balanced combat system, run:
```
CombatTest.RunTest("balance");
```

This will execute the full test suite including dice mechanics verification and combat simulation.
