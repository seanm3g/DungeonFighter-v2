### **Session 3: User Adjustments (2025-10-01 22:38:43)**
**File**: `balance_analysis_2025-10-01_22-38-43.txt`
**Results**:

   - Crystal Golem: Health 55â†’45, Strength 5â†’4, Armor 3â†’2 (Dagger 0% win rate)

**Reasoning**: User made major pool increases, AI focused on specific outliers

### **Session 4: Binary Search Major Adjustment (2025-10-01 22:39:XX)**
**File**: `balance_analysis_2025-10-01_22-38-43.txt` (latest)
**Results**:
- Average Win Rate: 78.9%
- Accuracy: 0/76 enemies (0%)
- Status: **CRITICAL - 60 enemies too easy, 16 too hard**

**Binary Search Analysis**:
- **Accuracy <50%**: Triggered major changes (Â±50% adjustments)
- **Primary Issue**: 60 enemies too easy (â‰¥98% win rate)
- **Strategy**: Increase enemy effectiveness to make them stronger

**Major Changes Applied**:
1. **StatConversionRates Major Increase (+50%)**:
   - StrengthPerPoint: 1.0 â†’ 1.5 (+50%)
   - AgilityPerPoint: 1.0 â†’ 1.5 (+50%)
   - TechniquePerPoint: 1.0 â†’ 1.5 (+50%)
   - IntelligencePerPoint: 1.0 â†’ 1.5 (+50%)
   - HealthPerPoint: 1.2 â†’ 1.8 (+50%)
   - ArmorPerPoint: 0.08 â†’ 0.12 (+50%)

**Reasoning**: Binary search major adjustment due to 0% accuracy - 60 enemies too easy need to be made stronger

---

### **Session 5: Binary Search Overshoot Correction (2025-10-01 22:47:16)**
**File**: `balance_analysis_2025-10-01_22-47-16.txt`
**Results**:
- Average Win Rate: 0.0%
- Accuracy: 0/76 enemies (0%)
- Status: **CRITICAL OVERSHOOT - 76 enemies too hard**

**Overshoot Analysis**:
- **Previous**: 78.9% win rate (60 too easy, 16 too hard)
- **Current**: 0.0% win rate (76 enemies too hard)
- **Overshoot**: Massive swing to opposite extreme
- **Binary Search Response**: Halve adjustment and reverse direction

**Overshoot Correction Applied**:
1. **StatConversionRates Overshoot Correction (-25% from overshoot values)**:
   - StrengthPerPoint: 1.5 â†’ 1.125 (-25% from overshoot)
   - AgilityPerPoint: 1.5 â†’ 1.125 (-25% from overshoot)
   - TechniquePerPoint: 1.5 â†’ 1.125 (-25% from overshoot)
   - IntelligencePerPoint: 1.5 â†’ 1.125 (-25% from overshoot)
   - HealthPerPoint: 1.8 â†’ 1.35 (-25% from overshoot)
   - ArmorPerPoint: 0.12 â†’ 0.09 (-25% from overshoot)

**Reasoning**: Binary search overshoot response - halved the +50% adjustment and reversed direction to correct the massive overshoot

---

### **Session 6: Binary Search Fine-Tuning (2025-10-01 22:48:23)**
**File**: `balance_analysis_2025-10-01_22-48-23.txt`
**Results**:
- Average Win Rate: 0.0%
- Accuracy: 0/76 enemies (0%)
- Status: **STILL TOO HARD - No improvement from overshoot correction**

**Fine-Tuning Analysis**:
- **Previous**: 0.0% win rate (76 enemies too hard)
- **Current**: 0.0% win rate (76 enemies too hard)
- **Assessment**: Overshoot correction insufficient
- **Strategy**: Continue reducing StatConversionRates (fine-tuning phase)

**Fine-Tuning Adjustment Applied**:
1. **StatConversionRates Fine-Tuning (-25% from correction values)**:
   - StrengthPerPoint: 1.125 â†’ 0.85 (-25% from correction)
   - AgilityPerPoint: 1.125 â†’ 0.85 (-25% from correction)
   - TechniquePerPoint: 1.125 â†’ 0.85 (-25% from correction)
   - IntelligencePerPoint: 1.125 â†’ 0.85 (-25% from correction)
   - HealthPerPoint: 1.35 â†’ 1.0 (-25% from correction)
   - ArmorPerPoint: 0.09 â†’ 0.07 (-25% from correction)

**Reasoning**: Binary search fine-tuning - overshoot correction didn't improve situation, continue reducing StatConversionRates

---

### **Session 7: Binary Search Lower Bound Search (2025-10-01 22:49:XX)**
**File**: `balance_analysis_2025-10-01_22-48-23.txt` (latest)
**Results**:
- Average Win Rate: 0.0%
- Accuracy: 0/76 enemies (0%)
- Status: **CORRECTING BINARY SEARCH STRATEGY**

**Binary Search Strategy Correction**:
- **Error**: Moved to fine-tuning before finding the two BIG tunings that bracket optimal value
- **Correct Approach**: Find lower bound (too easy) and upper bound (too hard), then fine-tune between them
- **Current Status**: 
  - Upper bound found: StatConversionRates = 1.125 (0% win rate - too hard)
  - Lower bound needed: Find StatConversionRates value where enemies become too easy

**Lower Bound Search Applied**:
1. **StatConversionRates Major Reduction (-50% from fine-tuning values)**:
   - StrengthPerPoint: 0.85 â†’ 0.5 (-50% to find lower bound)
   - AgilityPerPoint: 0.85 â†’ 0.5 (-50% to find lower bound)
   - TechniquePerPoint: 0.85 â†’ 0.5 (-50% to find lower bound)
   - IntelligencePerPoint: 0.85 â†’ 0.5 (-50% to find lower bound)
   - HealthPerPoint: 1.0 â†’ 0.6 (-50% to find lower bound)
   - ArmorPerPoint: 0.07 â†’ 0.04 (-50% to find lower bound)

**Reasoning**: Corrected binary search strategy - making BIG reduction to find lower bound where enemies become too easy, then will fine-tune between bounds

---

### **Session 8: Binary Search Lower Bound Continuation (2025-10-01 22:50:54)**
**File**: `balance_analysis_2025-10-01_22-50-54.txt`
**Results**:
- Average Win Rate: 1.3%
- Accuracy: 0/76 enemies (0%)
- Status: **PROGRESS TOWARD LOWER BOUND - 1 enemy too easy, 75 too hard**

**Lower Bound Search Progress**:
- **Previous**: 0.0% win rate (76 enemies too hard)
- **Current**: 1.3% win rate (75 enemies too hard, 1 too easy)
- **Assessment**: Moving toward lower bound but not there yet
- **Strategy**: Continue reducing StatConversionRates to find lower bound

**Lower Bound Search Continued**:
1. **StatConversionRates Major Reduction (-50% from 0.5 values)**:
   - StrengthPerPoint: 0.5 â†’ 0.25 (-50% to continue lower bound search)
   - AgilityPerPoint: 0.5 â†’ 0.25 (-50% to continue lower bound search)
   - TechniquePerPoint: 0.5 â†’ 0.25 (-50% to continue lower bound search)
   - IntelligencePerPoint: 0.5 â†’ 0.25 (-50% to continue lower bound search)
   - HealthPerPoint: 0.6 â†’ 0.3 (-50% to continue lower bound search)
   - ArmorPerPoint: 0.04 â†’ 0.02 (-50% to continue lower bound search)

**Reasoning**: Continue lower bound search - still too hard (1.3% win rate), need to find where enemies become too easy (â‰¥98% win rate)

---

### **Session 9: Binary Search Pool Adjustment (2025-10-01 22:51:XX)**
**File**: `balance_analysis_2025-10-01_22-50-54.txt` (latest)
**Results**:
- Average Win Rate: 1.3%
- Accuracy: 0/76 enemies (0%)
- Status: **CORRECTING BINARY SEARCH FOCUS**

**Binary Search Focus Correction**:
- **Error**: Adjusting StatConversionRates when should focus on pools at this level
- **Correct Approach**: Adjust SustainPool and AttributePool BasePointsAtLevel1
- **Current Pool Values**: AttributePool=50, SustainPool=60
- **Strategy**: Reduce pools to find lower bound where enemies become too easy

**Pool Adjustment Applied**:
1. **AttributePool Major Reduction (-50% from current values)**:
   - BasePointsAtLevel1: 50 â†’ 25 (-50% to find lower bound)
2. **SustainPool Major Reduction (-50% from current values)**:
   - BasePointsAtLevel1: 60 â†’ 30 (-50% to find lower bound)

**Reasoning**: Corrected binary search focus - adjusting pools instead of StatConversionRates to find lower bound where enemies become too easy

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Current State Analysis**
- **Accuracy**: Still 0% (no enemies in 85-98% range)
- **Win Rate**: 78.9% (closer to target but still off)
- **Issue**: Polarized results (60 too easy, 16 too hard)

### **Recommended Next Actions**
1. **Binary Search on StatConversionRates**: Fine-tune the 1.0 values
2. **Address Weapon Imbalance**: Wand still problematic (37% win rate)
3. **Focus on ArchetypeConfigs**: May need group-level adjustments
4. **Individual Enemy Refinement**: Continue targeting outliers

### **Binary Search Strategy**
- **Current Factor**: StatConversionRates (1.0 values)
- **Next Adjustment**: Â±25% (fine-tuning phase)
- **Direction**: Reduce slightly (78.9% still too high)
- **Target**: Move closer to 85-98% range

## ðŸ“‹ **LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **Major Changes Work**: Large adjustments can quickly move balance
2. **Overshoot is Common**: Need halving strategy when swinging too far
3. **Individual Enemies Matter**: Specific outliers need targeted fixes
4. **Weapon Balance**: Different weapons have different balance points
5. **Pool Impact**: Attribute/Sustain pools have massive global impact
