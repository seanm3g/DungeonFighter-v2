# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: ✅ **In Progress**

## Cleanup Strategy

Removing outdated documentation and updating remaining files to use correct class names (`CanvasUICoordinator` instead of `CanvasUICoordinator`).

## Files Deleted (Outdated Refactoring Plans)

1. ✅ `CANVASUIMANAGER_REFACTORING.md` - Outdated refactoring plan (refactoring complete)
2. ✅ `RENDERER_REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Outdated refactoring plan (refactoring complete)
3. ✅ `CANVAS_UI_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - Outdated summary (consolidated into COMPREHENSIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)

## Files Updated

1. ✅ `UI_ORGANIZATION.md` - Updated class name references
2. ✅ `COLOR_AND_TEXT_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` - Updated class name references
3. ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated class name and method references
4. ✅ `OVERVIEW.md` - Updated class name reference
5. ✅ `UI_RENDERER_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Updated all class name references
6. ✅ `COMPREHENSIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated class name references

## Remaining Files to Update

The following files still contain references to `CanvasUICoordinator` and should be updated or deleted based on relevance:

### Still Relevant (Should Update)
- Implementation summaries in `02-Development/`
- System documentation in `05-Systems/`
- Reference documentation in `04-Reference/`
- Quality documentation in `03-Quality/`

### Possibly Outdated (Review for Deletion)
- Old implementation summaries that have been consolidated
- Historical changelog entries (may keep as historical record)
- Archive files (already in 06-Archive/)

## Recommendation

For remaining files:
1. **Update** files that are still actively used/referenced
2. **Delete** files that have been fully consolidated into other documents
3. **Archive** files that have historical value but aren't actively used

## Next Steps

1. Review remaining files for relevance
2. Update class names in still-relevant files
3. Delete fully consolidated/outdated files
4. Verify all critical documentation is up-to-date

**Note**: This cleanup ensures only current, accurate documentation remains in the repository.
