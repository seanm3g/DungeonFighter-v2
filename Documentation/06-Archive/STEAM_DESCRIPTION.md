## About This Game

**Death is permanent. Mistakes are fatal. The game doesn't care if you're having fun.**

**Dungeon Fighter** is for players who remember when games didn't apologize for being difficult. This is a turn-based RPG that will chew you up and spit you out. No safety nets. No second chances. Just you, your wits, and the darkness that wants to devour your soul.

**Combat That Demands Respect**

Every attack is a gamble. Every combo is a commitment. Chain your strikes together and watch the damage multiply—or watch it all crumble when a single bad roll resets everything. The dice don't care about your strategy. They don't care about your build. They only care about one thing: are you good enough?

When your combo triggers and the numbers explode, that's not the game being nice. That's you earning it. When you miss and your combo shatters, that's the game reminding you who's in charge.

**Dungeons That Want You Dead**

Ten themed hellscapes. Each one designed to kill you in new and creative ways. The lava pits will burn you alive. The crypts will raise the dead against you. The swamps will slow you down while things with too many legs tear you apart. The rooms change. The enemies adapt. The only constant is that everything wants you dead.

Environmental hazards aren't flavor text—they're weapons. Use them or die. The dungeon doesn't play fair. Neither should you.

**Enemies That Don't Fuck Around**

That orc isn't a damage sponge—it's a wall of muscle that will break you. That spider isn't fast—it's a blur of fangs that will end you before you can react. That cultist isn't casting spells—it's rewriting reality to make your existence a mistake.

They scale with you. They learn from you. They exist to make you suffer. When you finally see an Ancient Sentinel, you won't feel excitement. You'll feel dread. Because you know what it means: you've come far enough that the game is done playing around.

**Builds That Matter**

Your character isn't a template. They're a weapon you forge through blood and death. Pick up a sword and become death. Grab a dagger and become shadow. Wield a staff and become destruction itself. Your equipment defines you. Your choices define you. Your failures define you.

Every piece of gear matters. Every stat point matters. Every action in your combo matters. Because when you die—and you will die—it all gets deleted. Start over. Do better. Or don't. The game doesn't care.

**Narratives Written in Your Blood**

The game doesn't sugarcoat your failures. When you die, the narrative doesn't comfort you. It tells you what happened. It shows you the moment you fucked up. It chronicles your last desperate combo, your final mistake, your ultimate failure.

But when you succeed? When you draw first blood? When you turn the tide? When you execute that perfect combo that ends everything? The narrative celebrates. Because you earned it. You fought for it. You bled for it.

**ASCII Aesthetics, Metal Soul**

The visuals are brutal simplicity. ASCII art that doesn't apologize. Colors that scream. An interface that shows you everything you need to know—because in the depths, ignorance is death. The title screen doesn't welcome you. It warns you.

This isn't a game that tries to look pretty. It's a game that looks like what it is: a descent into darkness where style points don't matter and survival is the only metric.

**The Bottom Line**

Tired of roguelikes that hold your hand? Tired of games that apologize for difficulty? Tired of death meaning nothing?

This is for you.

Every run is permanent. Every death is final. Every victory is earned. No savescumming. No takebacks. No mercy.

Master the combos. Learn the dungeons. Respect the enemies. Or die. The game doesn't care which you choose.

**Enter the darkness. If you dare.**
