## Configuration Files

### Primary Configuration
- `GameData/TuningConfig.json` - Main configuration file with all tuning parameters

### Extended Configuration
- `GameData/ItemScalingConfig.json` - Weapon-type specific scaling formulas and rarity modifiers

## Formula System

The system supports mathematical expressions with variables:

```json
{
  "WeaponDamageFormula": {
    "Formula": "BaseDamage * (1 + (Tier - 1) * TierScaling + Level * LevelScaling)",
    "TierScaling": 2.5,
    "LevelScaling": 0.8
  }
}
```

### Supported Operations
- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Power operations: `^` (converted to Math.Pow)
- Parentheses for grouping
- Variable substitution with exact matching

### Common Variables
- `BaseDamage`, `BaseArmor` - Base item values
- `Tier` - Item tier (1-5)
- `Level` - Player/enemy level
- `PlayerLevel` - Specific player level
- `TierScaling`, `LevelScaling` - Scaling factors

## Balance Analysis Features

### DPS Analysis
- Calculates theoretical DPS for different weapon tiers and player levels
- Factors in critical hits, combo potential, and attribute scaling
- Provides growth rate analysis across level ranges

### Item Distribution Analysis
- Simulates large-scale item generation (1000+ samples)
- Reports tier and rarity distribution percentages
- Identifies potential balance issues automatically

### Combat Scenarios
- Automated combat simulations with various player/enemy matchups
- Win rate calculations and average combat duration
- Player survivability analysis

### Progression Analysis
- Experience requirement curves
- Attribute growth visualization
- Growth rate calculations and balance recommendations

## Usage Examples

### Adjusting Weapon Scaling
1. Access Tuning Console â†’ Item Scaling Formulas
2. Modify Tier Scaling or Level Scaling values
3. Test changes with "Test Scaling Calculations"
4. Run balance analysis to verify impact

### Balancing Rarity System
1. Access Tuning Console â†’ Rarity System
2. Adjust multipliers for specific rarity tiers
3. Run "Item Distribution Analysis" to verify changes
4. Export configuration when satisfied

### Combat Balancing
1. Access Tuning Console â†’ Combat Parameters
2. Adjust critical hit rates, damage multipliers
3. Run "Combat Scenario Testing" to evaluate impact
4. Fine-tune based on win rates and combat duration

## Tips for Effective Tuning

### Start Small
- Make incremental changes (10-20% adjustments)
- Test after each change
- Use the analysis tools to verify impact

### Use Analysis Tools
- Always run balance analysis after major changes
- Pay attention to growth rates and distribution warnings
- Test multiple scenarios before finalizing changes

### Document Changes
- Export configurations with descriptive names
- Keep notes on what changes were made and why
- Test both early game and late game scenarios

### Common Balance Points
- **Early Game**: Focus on tier 1-2 weapons, levels 1-5
- **Mid Game**: Balance tier 3-4 equipment, levels 6-15
- **Late Game**: Ensure tier 5 items and high-level scaling remain challenging

## Troubleshooting

### Formula Errors
- Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure parentheses are balanced
- Verify mathematical operators are supported

### Configuration Issues
- Use "Reload Configuration" if changes don't appear
- Check JSON syntax in configuration files
- Restart application if major structural changes are made

### Performance Considerations
- Large analysis samples (>5000) may take time
- Complex formulas with many operations may slow calculations
- Consider simpler formulas for frequently-called calculations

## Integration with Existing Systems

The tuning system integrates seamlessly with:
- **LootGenerator**: Uses scaling formulas for item generation
- **Combat System**: Applies tuning parameters to damage calculations
- **Character Progression**: Uses progression curves for leveling
- **Enemy Scaling**: Applies scaling formulas to enemy stats

All changes take effect immediately without requiring game restart, making iterative tuning fast and efficient.
