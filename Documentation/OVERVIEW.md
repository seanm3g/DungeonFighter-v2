# DungeonFighter Game Overview

**Version 6.2** - *Production Ready*

## General Description

DungeonFighter is a sophisticated turn-based RPG/dungeon crawler game written in C# using .NET 8.0. The game features advanced combat mechanics with combo systems, intelligent battle narrative generation, and a comprehensive data-driven architecture. Built with modular design principles using established design patterns, the codebase is maintainable, extensible, and thoroughly tested.

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and navigate to the project
git clone <repo-url>
cd DungeonFighter-v2

# Build and run
cd Code
dotnet run
```

### For Developers
- **Architecture Overview**: See `Documentation/01-Core/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Development Guide**: See `Documentation/02-Development/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
- **Code Patterns**: See `Documentation/02-Development/CODE_PATTERNS.md`
- **Testing Guide**: See `Documentation/03-Quality/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`

## Core Features

### 🎮 Advanced Combat System
- **Turn-based Combat:** Strategic combat with cooldown-based action timing
- **Action Combo System:** Chain actions together for increased damage (1.85x multiplier per combo step)
- **Dice-based Mechanics:** 1d20 roll system with strategic thresholds
- **Roll Modification System:** Additive, multiplicative, clamp, reroll, exploding dice, multiple dice modes
- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Per-actor critical hit, combo, and hit threshold overrides
- **Conditional Triggers:** Event-driven action effects (OnMiss, OnHit, OnCritical, etc.)
- **Combo Routing:** Jump, skip, repeat, loop, stop, and random combo flow control
- **Tag System:** Flexible tag-based matching for damage modification and filtering
- **Outcome Handlers:** Conditional effects based on combat results (enemy death, HP thresholds)
- **Environmental Actions:** Room-specific effects that impact combat
- **Intelligent Delay System:** Optimized pacing matching action intensity
- **Combat timing tuning:** `GameData/TuningConfig.json` → `combat.baseAttackTime` is the baseline attack interval in seconds (agility curve and weapon then adjust it). If this or `minimumAttackTime` is missing or non-positive, the game applies safe defaults (**8s** / **0.1s**) after load so the STATS panel and turn pacing do not collapse to a near-zero display.

### 👤 Character & Progression System
- **Dynamic Stats:** Strength, Agility, Technique, Intelligence with level-based scaling
- **XP & Leveling:** Automatic stat increases and health restoration on level up
- **Equipment System:** Weapons, armor with tier-based stats and special abilities
- **Weapon-Based Classes:** Barbarian, Warrior, Rogue, Wizard with unique progression paths
- **Class naming (two tracks):** **Level** is earned from **XP** only. Each **level up** while holding a weapon awards **+1 class point** on that weapon's path (Mace / Sword / Dagger / Wand); attributes do **not** grant levels or class points. The **on-screen class title** (HUD, menus, tooltips) uses **only weapon path class points**: **shape** = solo, duo, or **3+** paths with ≥1 point, but the title stays the **Starting name** until the **highest** path’s class points reach **`tierThresholds[0]`** (first gate); then **tier prefixes** use that path’s points vs the same four `tierThresholds` as weapon tiers. **Solo and duo** titles are **tier prefix + core** only (no discipline “of the …” suffix on the HUD). When **three or four** paths have points, the title is the **duo hybrid name** for the **two highest** paths by points (ties: Mace → Sword → Dagger → Wand), then—if the **third-highest** path’s class points are ≥ **`tierThresholds[0]`**—the phrase for that path (Settings → Classes, **Third-path suffix (per path)** rows; defaults include **of the Veil** on the Dagger row when Dagger is third). **Settings → Classes** lists fields in editor order: **Starting name**, path names, tier thresholds, solo–trio tier words, 2-class duo cores, **Third-path suffix (per path)**, quad tier words, then path preview and live summary. **Weapon class points** also control **action unlocks**; path display names and tier **thresholds** live in `TuningConfig.json` (ranked-title tier words `Adept` / `Expert` / `Master` / `Paragon` are fixed in code). Class action templates use weapon point thresholds for unlocks.
- **Action Pool Management:** Dynamic action selection from equipped gear

### 👹 Enemy & AI System
- **18+ Enemy Types:** Each with unique stats, abilities, and specializations
- **Primary Attribute System:** Enemies specialize in Strength, Agility, or Technique
- **Level Scaling:** Dynamic stat scaling with proper DPS balance
- **Environment-Specific Spawning:** Different enemy types appear in themed dungeons

### 🗺️ Dungeon & Environment System
- **Procedural Generation:** 1-3 rooms per dungeon based on level
- **10 Themed Dungeons:** Forest, Lava, Crypt, Cavern, Swamp, Desert, Ice, Ruins, Castle, Graveyard
- **15+ Room Types:** Each with unique environmental actions and effects
- **Boss Chambers:** Special final rooms with powerful enemies

### 📖 Battle Narrative System
- **Event-Driven Narrative:** Poetic descriptions for significant combat moments
- **Informational Summaries:** Clear, factual combat reporting for regular actions
- **Significant Event Detection:** First blood, health reversals, near death, combo achievements
- **Configurable Display:** Balance between narrative and informational modes

### ✨ Modern GUI & Visual Systems (v6.2)
- **Avalonia-Based Interface:** Modern desktop GUI with ASCII canvas rendering
- **Persistent Layout:** Always-visible character panel with stats, health, and equipment
- **Item Color System:** Rarity-based visual feedback (Common → Transcendent) with 7 tiers
- **Color Configuration:** Data-driven JSON system with 166+ templates and 200+ keywords
- **Title Screen Animation:** Smooth 30 FPS color transition animations
- **Chunked Text Reveal:** Progressive text display with natural timing
- **1920×1080 Resolution:** Optimized for modern displays
- **Mouse & Keyboard Support:** Full input support with clickable UI elements

### 🔧 Technical Features
- **Data-Driven Architecture:** All game data stored in JSON for easy modification
- **Google Sheets multi-tab sync:** Published CSV URLs in `GameData/SheetsConfig.json` can pull **Actions**, **Weapons**, **Modifications**, **Armor**, and **class presentation** (from `TuningConfig.json`) from separate tabs. OAuth push (`SheetsPushConfig.json`) can write the same tabs in one run (Settings → Balance Tuning, or `PUSH_SHEETS` / `PULL_SHEETS` CLI). See `Documentation/02-Development/GOOGLE_SHEETS_INTEGRATION.md`.
- **Design Patterns:** Facade, Factory, Registry, Builder, Strategy, Composition, Observer
- **Advanced Mechanics System:** Roll modification, event-driven triggers, combo routing, tag system
- **Status Effect System:** 23 total effects (6 basic + 17 advanced) with stacking and duration tracking
- **Dynamic Tuning System:** Real-time parameter adjustment with FormulaEvaluator
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 27+ test categories with balance analysis
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
