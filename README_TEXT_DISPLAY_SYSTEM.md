# Text Display System Integration - READY TO TEST!

## 🎉 The New Text Display System is Now Active!

The new cohesive text display system has been integrated into the game and will be used when you run `dotnet run`. Here's what's been implemented:

## ✅ What's Working Now

### **1. Game Initialization**
- The new TextDisplaySystem is initialized when the game starts
- Configuration is loaded from `GameData/TextDisplayConfig.json`

### **2. Menu Systems**
- Main menu now uses the new text display system
- Settings menu includes new "Text Display Settings" option
- All menu text follows the new display order and timing

### **3. Combat System**
- Combat results and narrative messages are displayed in the correct order
- "First blood" and other narrative messages appear after the combat result that triggered them
- Entity tracking works properly (blank lines between different entities)

### **4. Settings Integration**
- New "Text Display Settings" option in the main settings menu
- Can toggle between new system and legacy UIManager
- Can choose from different presets (Fast, Cinematic, Balanced, Debug)
- Test function to see the system in action

## 🚀 How to Test

### **1. Run the Game**
```bash
dotnet run
```

### **2. Test the New System**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Text Display Settings**
2. Try the **"Test Text Display"** option to see the new system in action
3. Try different presets to see how they affect timing

### **3. Test Combat**
1. Start a new game
2. Enter a dungeon and fight an enemy
3. Notice how narrative messages now appear in the correct order:
   - Combat result first: `[Player] hits [Enemy] for X damage`
   - Then narrative: `The first drop of blood is drawn!`
   - Then status effects: `Player is bleeding for 2 turns`

### **4. Test Menu Navigation**
- Notice the consistent timing and formatting in all menus
- Try switching between presets to see different delay behaviors

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### **Presets Available**
- **Fast**: No delays, quick combat (good for testing)
- **Cinematic**: Longer delays for dramatic effect
- **Balanced**: Default balanced experience
- **Debug**: No delays, extra info for development

### **Custom Configuration**
Edit `GameData/TextDisplayConfig.json` to customize:
- Display order of message types
- Delay timing for each message type
- Whether to show entity names
- Whether to add blank lines between entities

## 🔄 Fallback System

The system includes a fallback option:
- In **Settings** → **Text Display Settings** → **Text System**
- You can toggle between "New System" and "Legacy UIManager"
- This allows you to compare the old vs new behavior

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **Before (Old System)**
```
The first drop of blood is drawn! The battle has truly begun.
[Player] hits [Enemy] with BASIC ATTACK for 10 damage
    (roll: 15 | attack 10 - 0 armor | speed: 8.7s)
```

### **After (New System)**
```
[Player] hits [Enemy] with BASIC ATTACK for 10 damage
    (roll: 15 | attack 10 - 0 armor | speed: 8.7s)
The first drop of blood is drawn! The battle has truly begun.
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If the new system isn't working:**
1. Check that `GameData/TextDisplayConfig.json` exists
2. Try the "Test Text Display" option in settings
3. Switch to "Legacy UIManager" and back to "New System"
4. Check the console for any error messages

### **If you want to revert to the old system:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Text Display Settings**
2. Set **Text System** to "Legacy UIManager"
3. The game will use the old UIManager system
