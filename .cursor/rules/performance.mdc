# Performance Rules for DungeonFighter-v2

## Performance Monitoring
Always monitor performance:

1. **Execution Time**: Track operation duration
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption
3. **Garbage Collection**: Watch for GC pressure
4. **Scalability**: Test with large datasets

## Performance Targets
- Combat Response: <100ms for simple actions
- Menu Navigation: <50ms response time
- Data Loading: <500ms for all game data
- Memory Usage: <200MB peak usage
- Startup Time: <5 seconds total

## Optimization Techniques
- Use lazy loading for data
- Implement object pooling
- Cache expensive calculations
- Use efficient data structures
- Optimize algorithms

## Performance Testing
- Run performance tests regularly
- Monitor memory usage
- Test under load
- Profile bottlenecks
- Verify optimizations

## Performance Best Practices
- Use appropriate data structures
- Avoid unnecessary object creation
- Cache expensive calculations
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Optimize for common cases
