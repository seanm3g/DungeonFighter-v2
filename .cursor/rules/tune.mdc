# DungeonFighter Balance Tuning Process

DO NOT try to run code to check for balance.

## Step 1: Read Required Documentation
**CRITICAL**: Read `Documentation/TUNING_FACTORS_ANALYSIS.md` FIRST to understand which tuning factors actually work!

## Step 2: Find Latest Balance Analysis
Check the balance file with the latest date in year-month-day_hour-minute-second format.
**At the TOP of your response, state which file you read.**

## Step 3: Understand Win Rate Logic
- **Win Rate = Player Win Rate** (how often the player beats the enemy)
- **Target Range**: 85-98% player win rate (players should win 85-98% of the time)

### Enemy Categories:
- **Too Easy** (player win rate >98%): Players win too much → Make enemies HARDER
- **Too Hard** (player win rate <85%): Players win too little → Make enemies EASIER

### Effectiveness Adjustments:
- **INCREASE effectiveness** = STRONGER enemies = LOWER player win rate = HARDER for players
- **DECREASE effectiveness** = WEAKER enemies = HIGHER player win rate = EASIER for players

## Step 4: Tuning Hierarchy (Apply in Order)
1. **Global Level**: `StatConversionRates` in TuningConfig.json (affects all enemies)
2. **Archetype Level**: `ArchetypeConfigs` in TuningConfig.json (affects enemy groups)
3. **Individual Level**: Specific enemy stats in Enemies.json (affects specific enemies)
4. **Action Level**: Action damage multipliers in Actions.json (affects all enemies using that action)

## Step 5: Analysis Process
1. **Identify Outliers**: Find enemies with win rates outside 85-98% range
2. **Group Analysis**: Look for common patterns (archetype, tier, actions used)
3. **Root Cause**: Determine which tuning factor affects the problematic group
4. **Apply Fix**: Make targeted adjustments to the appropriate level

## Step 6: Adjustment Guidelines

### For Enemies Too Easy (>98% win rate):
- **INCREASE** stat conversion rates (e.g., 0.8 → 1.0)
- **INCREASE** health, damage, or armor values
- **INCREASE** archetype effectiveness multipliers

### For Enemies Too Hard (<85% win rate):
- **DECREASE** stat conversion rates (e.g., 1.0 → 0.8)
- **DECREASE** health, damage, or armor values
- **DECREASE** archetype effectiveness multipliers

## Step 7: Hero Adjustments
If multiple enemy types are problematic, consider adjusting:
- Hero base stats
- Starting weapon damage
- Character progression scaling

## Step 8: Validation
After adjustments, run balance analysis again to verify changes moved win rates toward target range.

**Remember**: Start with global changes, then archetype, then individual enemies. Reference `TUNING_FACTORS_ANALYSIS.md` for specific recommendations.
